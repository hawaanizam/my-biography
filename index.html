<h1> THIS IS MY PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY
<h2> MY NAME IS NUR ALIFFAH HAWA BINTI MOHAMAD NIZAM. I AM 22 YEARS OLD.

<h3>I LOVE NATURE</h3>
<p> Nature is a source of inspiration.There is no doubt that nature brings about inspiration. 
This usually realized when a person’s mind is full of stress and everything seems difficult and 
overshadowed in the mind. Taking a walk at the park will brings me excitement due to the 
admiring the nature. The display of flora and fauna provide endless description of the 
beauty that flows in a person’s mind. The beautiful dew drops on the leave blades and on the 
grass are iridescent pearls. At night, the crescent moon that is silvery and the twinkling milky way
are entertaining. The waterfalls and the roaring oceans, thunder and flash lightning 
with rainfalls give the violent aspect of nature.</p>

<h4> I LOVE MUSIC</h4>
<p> Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes me. 
Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various 
musical instruments. It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, depression, insomnia. 
It also helps in improving the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.</p>
